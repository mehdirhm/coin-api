# Crypto Info Project

## Description

This project is built using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development. It utilizes TypeScript to enhance the development experience and add static typing to the codebase, making it more robust and maintainable.

The main functionality of this project is to display information about cryptocurrencies using the CoinGecko API. The CoinGecko API provides comprehensive data on various cryptocurrencies, including their current market prices, historical data, and other relevant information.

The project also includes a dark mode and light mode feature that allows users to switch between different color themes based on their preferences.

### Features

- View a list of cryptocurrencies with their basic details.
- Search for specific cryptocurrencies using the search functionality.
- Access detailed information about each cryptocurrency, including its description and other essential data.
- Toggle between dark mode and light mode for a personalized viewing experience.
### Last Three Search Inputs

On the homepage, the project saves the last three search inputs entered by the user using local storage. This means that even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser, the last three search inputs will still be visible on the homepage.
